#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Branch of Computer Science that deals with systematically applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to
develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It involves software product design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Importance of Software Engineering 
Improves Productivity and Efficiency
With the use of technology in workplaces, organizations have been able to increase their 
productivity and efficiency at a rapid pace. Processes that were once manual and time-consuming 
can now be achieved in a quick and efficient manner with digital tools, applications, and systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Machine Language Era (1940s): The first milestone was the creation of machine language, a low-level programming language that allowed programmers to write instructions using only 0s and 1s. This was a significant step in the evolution of software engineering as it enabled the development of more complex programs.

High-Level Programming Languages (1950s-1960s): The introduction of high-level programming languages, such as FORTRAN and COBOL, marked the second milestone. These languages were more user-friendly, reducing the complexity of programming and increasing productivity.

Object-Oriented Programming (1960s-1970s): The third milestone is the advent of object-oriented programming (OOP), which introduced concepts like classes, objects, and methods. OOP revolutionized software engineering by enabling the creation of modular, reusable code, and it forms the basis of many modern programming languag

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Design: In this phase, system and software design documents are prepared based on the requirement specifications. The design serves as a blueprint for the following development phase.

Development: Developers build the software according to the design specifications. This is where coding, debugging, and unit testing take place.

Testing: The software is tested to ensure it meets the specified requirements and doesn't have any bugs. Various testing techniques, like integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing, are employed.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: A software developer is responsible for designing, coding, debugging, and modifying software applications according to project requirements. They write well-designed, testable, and efficient code, collaborate with team members, and ensure software meets quality, functionality, and performance requirements.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: A QA engineer is responsible for planning, executing, and reporting on software testing to ensure software quality. They design and implement tests, debug, and define corrective actions, review system requirements and track quality assurance metrics. They also collaborate with developers and project managers to ensure timely delivery of high-quality software.

Project Manager: A project manager coordinates and leads the software engineering team, planning and organizing resources, timelines, and tasks to ensure successful project delivery. They define project scope, goals, and deliverables, manage risks, and communicate project status to stakeholders. They also facilitate collaboration, resolve issues, and remove obstacles that might impact project progress.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of IDE'S
Streamlined Workflow: IDEs integrate various tools and features into a single environment, allowing developers to write, edit, test, and debug code without switching between different applications. This streamlines the development process, making it more efficient.

Code Assistance: Modern IDEs offer features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and real-time error detection, which help developers write cleaner and more error-free code. These features reduce the cognitive load on developers by automating mundane tasks, allowing them to focus on solving problems and writing logic. eg Visual Studio Code (VS Code): A lightweight, yet powerful IDE that supports a wide range of programming languages and is highly extensible through a rich ecosystem of plugins.
IntelliJ IDEA: A popular IDE, particularly for Java development, known for its advanced code completion, refactoring tools, and deep integration with build tools like Maven and Gradle.
Importance of VCS
Collaboration: VCSs enable multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. They manage changes to source code over time, allowing teams to collaborate more effectively, whether they are in the same office or distributed across the globe.

History and Revisions: VCSs maintain a complete history of every change made to the codebase. This allows developers to track who made changes, what was changed, and why. If a bug is introduced, developers can easily revert to a previous version of the code, making it easier to maintain and debug software. egGit: The most widely used VCS, Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to work on code offline and later synchronize changes. Git's branching and merging capabilities are particularly powerful, making it a favorite among developers. GitHub and GitLab are platforms built around Git that provide additional collaboration tools.
Subversion (SVN): A centralized VCS that was widely used before Git became dominant. SVN still has a presence in some organizations, particularly those with legacy systems.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenge: As software projects grow in size and scope, the complexity of the codebase increases. Managing this complexity can become overwhelming, leading to issues like tightly coupled code, poor maintainability, and difficulty in debugging.
Strategies:
Modular Design: Break the software into smaller, manageable modules or components with well-defined interfaces. This approach promotes reusability and easier maintenance.
Design Patterns: Use design patterns to solve common problems in a standardized way. Patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller) or Singleton can help manage complexity effectively.
Code Refactoring: Regularly refactor code to improve its structure without changing its functionality. This helps keep the codebase clean and easier to understand.
Challenge: Requirements often change during the development process due to evolving business needs, user feedback, or market conditions. Adapting to these changes can be challenging, especially if they occur late in the development cycle.
Strategies:
Agile Methodologies: Adopt Agile practices, such as iterative development and regular feedback loops, to accommodate changing requirements. Agile promotes flexibility and continuous delivery of value.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Ensures that individual components work correctly, promoting high-quality code.
Integration Testing: Verifies that components work together as expected, ensuring proper interaction between parts of the system.
System Testing: Validates that the complete system meets the specified requirements and works in an integrated environment.
Acceptance Testing: Confirms that the software meets the needs of the end-users and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Refers to the  practice of designing and refining prompts—specific inputs or instructions—to effectively communicate with and extract desired responses from AI models for accuracy and efficiency
Importance of intergrating with AI Models
Precision and Clarity: Well-crafted prompts can guide AI models to provide more accurate and relevant answers. By clearly specifying the desired outcome, prompt engineering minimizes ambiguity and helps the model focus on the most relevant information.
Reducing Errors and Bias: Poorly designed prompts may lead to irrelevant, inaccurate, or biased responses. Through careful prompt engineering, users can reduce these risks by steering the model away from common pitfalls or misunderstandings.
Efficiency: Effective prompts lead to more useful responses, reducing the need for follow-up questions or clarifications. This streamlines interactions and makes the AI more efficient and user-friendly.
Customization: Prompt engineering allows users to tailor the AI's responses to specific needs or contexts. For example, a prompt can be designed to elicit responses in a particular style, tone, or level of detail, making the interaction more personalized.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt  
Generate a song that describes the protests happening in Kenya
Improved prompt which is clear,specific and concise
You are an upcoming artist and songwriter  from Kenya in arbantone, renowned for your ability to create songs that are in alignment to the trending issues in Kenya. Your task is to compose an arbantone song that exemplifies how artistic expression can intersect with technological themes. This song should describe the current  political situation in kenya  where the Generation z popularly known as Gen z have started a revolution  in regards to the proposed finance bill. The bill is meant to impose more taxes on kenyans ,on their lands,cars and other human basic needs. The song should educate kenyans on the importance of doing away with tribalism for a better future. The song should show the fearlessness from the gen z on a ,mission to overthrow the unfair members of the government . The format of your work will include two verses and a chorus to engage a live audience effectively. The tone should be inspirational, energetic and informative maintaining the authentic rhythm and typical impactful  of arbantone music. You will perform this track to a large audience of kenyans with a keen interest in educating kenyans about the importance of good governance and wise decisions during elections. The chorus should show how police officers are using forceful ways to attack the peaceful protestants using teagas and using water cannisters, how they are kidnapping them and harrassing them but all in all the gen z stands strong
The improved prompt is more effective because it provides the AI with a clear, specific, and concise instruction set, leading to a more relevant, accurate, and useful response. 
By reducing vagueness, the improved prompt ensures that the interaction is efficient and meets the user's needs precisely.
